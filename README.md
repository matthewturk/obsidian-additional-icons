# Additional Icons for Obsidian
This plugin adds additional icons for use anywhere obsidian normally uses the set from https://lucide.dev/ .

At present, it includes:

 - [RPG Awesome](https://nagoshiashumari.github.io/Rpg-Awesome/)
 - [GovIcons](https://govicons.io/)

Each iconset is bundled, but can be toggled.
